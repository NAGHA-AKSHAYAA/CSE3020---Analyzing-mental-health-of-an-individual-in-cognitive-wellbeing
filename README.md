# CSE3020---Analyzing-mental-health-of-an-individual-in-cognitive-wellbeing

## Project Information

Mental health pertains to an individual's emotional and social well-being, and consequently, it plays a direct role in their cognitive well-being. Cognitive well-being, on the other hand, refers to an individual's ability to reason, think, work, and remember. 

The objective of this study is to evaluate an individual's mental health concerning their cognitive well-being and thus gain a baseline understanding of progression of mental health disturbances in order to aid suicide prevention. 

We propose an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, which uses the questionnaire data from the NHAES website. The questionnaire input includes questions on their socioeconomic status, demographic information, dietary habits, and health. 

The ANN model will be able to forecast the mental health of a person to assist early detection and prevention of mental health disorders and thus improve overall mental health outcomes of the person. We have also applied this ANN on the Heart Rate Variability dataset to address physical factors such as workplace pressure and distractions that can lead to stress. Our study aims to improve our understanding of the connection between mental health and cognitive well-being, which can facilitate the development of effective interventions and treatments for people facing mental health issues.
